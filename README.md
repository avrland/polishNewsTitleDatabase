# polishNewsTitleDatabase
Polish news database for analysis and ML purposes. Collected mostly from Google News aggregator. 

Tags I used to collect newses:
```python
newsTags = [ "swiat", "koronawirus", "pis", "polska", "sport", "apple", "samsung", "technologia", "COVID-19", "amazon", "google", "gospodarka", "chiny", "rozrywka", "nauka"]
```
* Feel free to try how does it works in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/avrland/polishNewsTitleDatabase/blob/main/GoogleNews_scrapper_to_textfile.ipynb). 
* [scrapper+scheduler.py](https://github.com/avrland/polishNewsTitleDatabase/blob/main/scrapper%2Bscheduler.py) took Jupyter Notebook to simple python script which you can run at your machine to collect newses everyday automatically.
